# ESLint Configuration Notes

## Max Warnings Configuration

The `lint` script is configured with `--max-warnings 5` instead of the typical `--max-warnings 0`.

This is intentional due to the `react-refresh/only-export-components` warning that appears when exporting utility functions (like hooks) alongside components. This is a known limitation of the react-refresh plugin when working with utility files that export both components and hooks.

The affected files are:
- `src/lib/django-templates.tsx` - Exports both `DjangoTemplate` component and `useDjangoTemplate` hook
- `src/lib/auth-context.tsx` - Exports both `AuthProvider` component and `useAuth` hook

These warnings are safe to ignore as these patterns are standard in React applications for organizing related functionality.

To maintain code quality, all other ESLint rules are enforced strictly with no exceptions.
